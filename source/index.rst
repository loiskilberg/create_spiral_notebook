Introducing Small Spiral Notebooks
==================================

At |llc|, we offer a large variety of small notebooks. We place our fine art reproductions and map prints on the front covers. These notebooks are very portable to take along with you, which makes it fun and easy to write notes almost anywhere!

The wire spiral allows you to have a flat surface to write on without taking up extra space. The heavy matboard backing strongly supports your writing or drawing. The inner pages are made from paper which is easy to draw on and is acid-free.

We are calling them small notebooks in this document because most of the sizes are smaller than a standard 8.5" x 11" paper, although we do offer the standard size as well.

There are a variety of ways to make notebooks. This document will describe how we are currently making them at |lla|. By reading this document, perhaps you are interested in how we make our notebooks. Or, perhaps you are actually assisting |llc| to create the notebooks and want to learn the process.

You can buy these notebooks already made at our |etsyNotebooks| or by emailing a request to |emailInfoLLC|.

Steps to Create Your Own Small Spiral Notebooks
###############################################
We typically use the plural term "notebooks" in this document. That is because you can often fit more than one smaller notebook on a regular sized sheet of paper, making it efficient to make more than one notebook at a time. However, you can also follow the steps to make just a single notebook. 

You can follow all the steps in sequence without stopping, or you can do some steps and then wait until later to complete the notebooks.
