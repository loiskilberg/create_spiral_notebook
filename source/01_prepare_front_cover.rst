Preparing the Notebook's Front Cover
####################################

Gathering the Image for the Front Outside Cover
===============================================

First, you will want to get the image ready that will go on the outside of the front cover. If you are making more than one notebook at a time, you can either use the same image for all the notebooks or you can change the image on one or more of the notebooks in the batch. In these steps, we will use the term "image" to represent one or more of the chosen images.

Additionally, you may use just an excerpt of an image to go on the cover. In these steps, the term "image" will represent the image or the part of the original image that you will use for the cover.

#. Select an image for the notebooks by:

  * Looking through your library of high resolution images, or
  
  * Using any high resolution image that has been specified for you
  
#. Decide how you will adjust the image to meet the following requirements:

  * The image resolution should be at least 300 dpi in order to look good when printed.
  * The orientation of the image should match the chosen orientation of the notebooks.
  * If you need to resize the image to make it larger in order to fill the final notebook size, keep the quality high by enlarging it no more than about 125% of the original image size (unless it is a vector image, in which case there are no resizing limits).
  * When you resize the image, it is likely that you will need to crop the image on at least one dimension. Make sure that nothing important is cut off when you do the cropping.
  * There will eventually be holes punched in either the top or left side of the cover. This will occur within about 1/4" of that edge. Make sure that the holes will not cause important parts of the image to be lost.
  If you want a white border around the image:
    - Decide how wide the white border should be, and make the image that much smaller than the final notebook size.
    - You will not need a *bleed* in the layout.
  If you want the image to extend to the very edge of the cover:
    - You will need a *bleed* so that trimming the cover later won't result in tiny slivers of white showing, so make the image about 1/8" larger than the final notebook size on each side (top, bottom, left, right).
    - Make sure that the important parts of your image fit within the final notebook size and won't be trimmed off later.  
  
Creating the Printing Layout
============================

#. layout outside with image, PhotoShop, bleed, gutter for holes, aligning multiples on one page, esp for small sizes which must be multiples to be large enough for binding machine
#. layout inside to align on backside, get desc, logo, maybe SKU
#. laminate 5mil
#. punching
